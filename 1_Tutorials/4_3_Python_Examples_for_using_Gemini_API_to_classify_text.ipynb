      "Have you played with generative artificial intelligence like ChatGPT, for text, or DALL-E or Midjourney, for images? What have you used it for? What have you discovered?If you’re new to the topic, this glossary explains that generative A.I. is technology that creates content — including text, images, video and computer code — by identifying patterns in large quantities of training data, and then creating original material that has similar characteristics.In their article “35 Ways Real People Are Using A.I. Right Now,” Francesca Paris and Larry Buchanan explain how these tools are being used to help with everyday tasks:The public release of ChatGPT last fall kicked off a wave of interest in artificial intelligence. A.I. models have since snaked their way into many people’s everyday lives. Despite their flaws, ChatGPT and other A.I. tools are helping people to save time at work, to code without knowing how to code, to make daily life easier or just to have fun.It goes beyond everyday fiddling: In the last few years, companies and scholars have started to use A.I. to supercharge work they could never have imagined, designing new molecules with the help of an algorithm or building alien-like spaceship parts.Here’s how 35 real people are using A.I. for work, life, play and procrastination.Here are a few of the ideas mentioned in the article:Plan gardens.John Pritzlaff, gardenerMr. Pritzlaff is building a permaculture garden in his backyard in Phoenix, where he uses drought-resistant trees to give shade to other species.“I do these ultra-high-density planting arrangements,” he said. “And I’ve been employing ChatGPT to give me inspiration on species that wouldn’t have otherwise occurred to me, and for choosing the site for each tree: the best part of the yard with regard to the sun at different times of the year.”Taking into account his geographical location, it suggested, for example, that he might use a moringa tree to provide shade for a star apple.Build a clock that gives you a new poem every minute.Matt Webb, consultant and blogger“Yes, programmatic A.I. is useful,” he said. “But more than that, it’s enormous fun.”Get homework help.Maya Upadhyay, high school studentMs. Upadhyay takes advanced placement math classes, like statistics and calculus, and says when she’s confused with a homework question, she’ll feed it into ChatGPT.It will give her an answer, but also step-by-step instructions on how it got there — a kind of self-guided tutoring process that she once used math apps or Khan Academy videos for.“Sometimes if I’m still confused, I can ask the A.I. to put it into simpler terms. It’s just become another option for me to use and it’s been really helpful to have whenever I need it.”Get feedback on fiction.Paul Gamlowski, microfiction author“After I finish 98 percent of a story, I prompt ChatGPT with:Summarize the meaning or symbolism of this story I wrote. Mention any plot twist. Speculate on the moral of the story. Analyze how well the story reads to an average reader grammatically and structurally. Analyze if the title matches appropriately.”If ChatGPT misses the point, or the moral, “that tells me as a writer probably many readers will miss it too.” And he’ll give it another shot. “So I just adjust a few words or a phrase and have it reanalyze and it gets it. It doesn’t take away from the story because I still write in a literary symbolic way, but it helps me get insight into what a future reader might get or miss.”Get help when English is your second language.Ronald Mannak, entrepreneur“If I can’t think of a particular word, for example, it is super easy to just describe the word, and GPT almost always knows what I mean, even if the description is really bad.”Students, read the entire article and then tell us:Which use of A.I. described in this article most excites or interests you? Why?Which uses were new to you?Did any give you ideas for ways to use the tools?How have you experimented with generative A.I. already, if at all? Did you have fun? Was it useful? What did you discover?We have asked students before about the ethics of using A.I. to help with schoolwork. One example in this article is about asking a chatbot to help with homework, and many more focus on using them to improve writing. Do you consider these uses ethical? Why or why not? Would your school allow them?What about these new tools do you find promising? What do you find troubling? Why?Students 13 and older in the United States and Britain, and 16 and older elsewhere, are invited to comment. All comments are moderated by the Learning Network staff, but please keep in mind that once your comment is accepted, it will be made public and may appear in print.Find more Student Opinion questions here.

      "[Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.Prepare to wait awhile longer for the return of “Stranger Things,” “Abbott Elementary” and a number of other beloved TV shows.Last week, the Writers Guild of America, which represents about 11,500 writers of television and film, went on strike after contract negotiations with studios and streaming services failed. It is the W.G.A.’s first strike in 15 years; the last strike, which began in 2007, lasted 100 days.The impasse has brought many television productions to a standstill. Last week, picket lines formed in Los Angeles and New York; late-night talk shows went dark and their slots have since been filled with reruns. With no solution in sight, the fate of popular shows — and perhaps, the fall TV season — hangs in the balance.In an interview, John Koblin, a media reporter who covers the TV industry for The New York Times, discussed how the rise of streaming services factored into the strike and where negotiations might go from here. This conversation has been edited.Can you tell me about the strike and what’s at stake for the W.G.A.?The writers went on strike early last week. They say this moment is existential and that the survival of the writing profession is at stake. The reason they’re using this really urgent language is because they say that their working conditions have deteriorated significantly in the streaming era.Despite the fact that there has been an explosion in television production, their pay has stagnated. W.G.A. leaders say this affects every writer, from the well-decorated showrunner to the junior writer just getting a foot in the door.What is the W.G.A. asking for?In a very 2023 twist, one of the issues is putting significant guardrails around the use of artificial intelligence. The writers are looking for this in two ways. One is that ChatGPT, for example, cannot write or be credited on a script. Another is to put guardrails against source material. An example that one screenwriter, John August, gave me was that a studio executive cannot have ChatGPT generate a 15-page document about pandas and then take that document to you and say, “Write a movie about pandas.”But really, the core of this strike is about compensation. There are two things they’re asking for. One is a miniroom, also known as a developing room. There’s no one definition for a miniroom, but they have proliferated over the last decade. In one example, studios will convene a miniroom before a show has been ordered to series. The writers claim that because it’s not a formal writers’ room, they will use that as justification to pay writers less, even though they’re writing scripts and developing a show.The other issue is the fact that 20 years ago, episode orders could be for 22, 24, 26 episodes. But in the streaming era, episode orders are much shorter — six, seven, eight episodes. As a result, writers say that they leave a miniroom or a writer’s room sooner than they would have in the past; they are left scrambling to find another job.How does this moment compare to the writer’s strike that began in 2007?You’ll hear the writers say, as united as they were then, they are even more united now. In 2007, they didn’t have a lot of other support from their union brethren. It’s very different this time around. Other unions, including the Hollywood union, voiced support for the writers. Another thing you’ll hear the writers say is that as significant as their ambitions were in 2007, it’s even more urgent now.W.G.A. renegotiates contracts with studios every three years. Why is this happening now?We could have potentially seen some labor issues in 2020, but the pandemic happened just as negotiations began. One of the chairs of the W.G.A.’s negotiating committee said, We only walk when we feel like we are facing an existential crisis and like something significant has happened. That is why you have these generational strikes; they usually accompany technological shifts. In 2007, that was the advent of the internet.Would you say this strike is the result of the rise of streaming services?Yes. A decade ago, Netflix introduced “House of Cards.” That was one of its first original shows. In the last four years, we’ve seen the rise of streaming services, such as Apple TV+ and HBO Max, and the decline of cable television. You’d be hard-pressed to find a lot of people who watch cable or network TV in the way that they did a few years ago.Where do you predict the strike goes from here?The talks broke down a week ago; there have been no negotiations all week. After the strike was called, one of the lead W.G.A. negotiators told me in an interview, “Philosophically and practically, we’re very far apart,” which is something that has been underscored and reiterated by company executives in recent days as well, including by Bob Bakish, the chief executive of Paramount.It’s such a significant gap right now, and the writers are very fired up and united. It’s really hard to predict, but there is a feeling within Hollywood that this could be a long strike.]\n",

      "[Have you played with generative artificial intelligence like ChatGPT, for text, or DALL-E or Midjourney, for images? What have you used it for? What have you discovered?If you’re new to the topic, this glossary explains that generative A.I. is technology that creates content — including text, images, video and computer code — by identifying patterns in large quantities of training data, and then creating original material that has similar characteristics.In their article “35 Ways Real People Are Using A.I. Right Now,” Francesca Paris and Larry Buchanan explain how these tools are being used to help with everyday tasks:The public release of ChatGPT last fall kicked off a wave of interest in artificial intelligence. A.I. models have since snaked their way into many people’s everyday lives. Despite their flaws, ChatGPT and other A.I. tools are helping people to save time at work, to code without knowing how to code, to make daily life easier or just to have fun.It goes beyond everyday fiddling: In the last few years, companies and scholars have started to use A.I. to supercharge work they could never have imagined, designing new molecules with the help of an algorithm or building alien-like spaceship parts.Here’s how 35 real people are using A.I. for work, life, play and procrastination.Here are a few of the ideas mentioned in the article:Plan gardens.John Pritzlaff, gardenerMr. Pritzlaff is building a permaculture garden in his backyard in Phoenix, where he uses drought-resistant trees to give shade to other species.“I do these ultra-high-density planting arrangements,” he said. “And I’ve been employing ChatGPT to give me inspiration on species that wouldn’t have otherwise occurred to me, and for choosing the site for each tree: the best part of the yard with regard to the sun at different times of the year.”Taking into account his geographical location, it suggested, for example, that he might use a moringa tree to provide shade for a star apple.Build a clock that gives you a new poem every minute.Matt Webb, consultant and blogger“Yes, programmatic A.I. is useful,” he said. “But more than that, it’s enormous fun.”Get homework help.Maya Upadhyay, high school studentMs. Upadhyay takes advanced placement math classes, like statistics and calculus, and says when she’s confused with a homework question, she’ll feed it into ChatGPT.It will give her an answer, but also step-by-step instructions on how it got there — a kind of self-guided tutoring process that she once used math apps or Khan Academy videos for.“Sometimes if I’m still confused, I can ask the A.I. to put it into simpler terms. It’s just become another option for me to use and it’s been really helpful to have whenever I need it.”Get feedback on fiction.Paul Gamlowski, microfiction author“After I finish 98 percent of a story, I prompt ChatGPT with:Summarize the meaning or symbolism of this story I wrote. Mention any plot twist. Speculate on the moral of the story. Analyze how well the story reads to an average reader grammatically and structurally. Analyze if the title matches appropriately.”If ChatGPT misses the point, or the moral, “that tells me as a writer probably many readers will miss it too.” And he’ll give it another shot. “So I just adjust a few words or a phrase and have it reanalyze and it gets it. It doesn’t take away from the story because I still write in a literary symbolic way, but it helps me get insight into what a future reader might get or miss.”Get help when English is your second language.Ronald Mannak, entrepreneur“If I can’t think of a particular word, for example, it is super easy to just describe the word, and GPT almost always knows what I mean, even if the description is really bad.”Students, read the entire article and then tell us:Which use of A.I. described in this article most excites or interests you? Why?Which uses were new to you?Did any give you ideas for ways to use the tools?How have you experimented with generative A.I. already, if at all? Did you have fun? Was it useful? What did you discover?We have asked students before about the ethics of using A.I. to help with schoolwork. One example in this article is about asking a chatbot to help with homework, and many more focus on using them to improve writing. Do you consider these uses ethical? Why or why not? Would your school allow them?What about these new tools do you find promising? What do you find troubling? Why?Students 13 and older in the United States and Britain, and 16 and older elsewhere, are invited to comment.

      "[When the San Francisco start-up OpenAI released ChatGPT late last year, the A.I. chatbot looked like the first significant threat in decades to Google. One day, tech insiders thought, it could make Google’s internet search engine look old and stodgy.Google executives vowed a fast response to protect the company’s $162 billion franchise and said that artificial intelligence would be woven throughout its products, from the search engine to email.On Wednesday, at its annual conference in Mountain View, Calif., the company demonstrated some of what it has been working on. Google said its search engine will begin incorporating responses generated by A.I. at the top of query results pages and allow users to ask follow-up questions.It was a notable step toward Google’s embrace of A.I., which many experts believe could remake the tech industry. Google was a pioneer in the technology, but had been reluctant to do too much with it because A.I. comes with risks, like spreading false information.But Google, along with the rest of Silicon Valley, was surprised by the success of ChatGPT. In December, Google declared a “code red” to find ways to incorporate the technology behind ChatGPT, called generative A.I., into its own products.Google said at its conference on Wednesday that it has now embedded its latest A.I. technology into 25 products, including the search updates and a feature to help users write emails in Gmail.“Seven years into our journey as an A.I.-first company, we are at an exciting inflection point,” Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, said at the conference. “With generative A.I., we’re taking the next step, with a bold and responsible approach, we are reimagining all of our products.”The company also doubled down on its hardware ambitions, releasing two new smartphones and a tablet. On the high end was the Pixel Fold, Google’s first folding phone. For the budget minded, it offered the Pixel 7A, a phone that costs $500. The company made its Pixel Tablet both portable and able to dock on a speaker, so it can function like a smart home display.Google has been racing against OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft. In February, Microsoft demonstrated how the newest version of Microsoft’s search engine, Bing, incorporates a chatbot that works with the technology developed by OpenAI.But Google is still taking a more measured approach than its main competitors. The company did not include a chatbot, which can be prone to making up false information, in its search engine. Instead, Google said it will use A.I. to provide some answers, which will be corroborated by authoritative websites, and it will continue including ads in responses.Liz Reid, a Google search vice president, said in an interview ahead of the conference that users expected the company to have high-quality information and it did not want to undermine that trust.“The technology is early,” Ms. Reid said. “It’s amazing in some ways and it has a bunch of challenges in other ways.”To work with the latest search features, users need to sign up for Search Labs, a new effort that allows users and the company to test experimental features. The New York Times previously reported that Google will let up to 30 million people in the United States use the updates by the end of the year.In March, Google released Bard, an experimental chatbot meant to compete with ChatGPT. Google on Wednesday broadened access the tool, bringing it to more than 180 countries and territories in English, and also offering it in Japanese and Korean.Mr. Pichai also discussed the company’s efforts to build more powerful A.I. technology. He unveiled the latest version of that more powerful technology, Pathways Language Model 2, or PaLM 2, and said work had begun on an even larger model named Gemini.A.I. models are the huge systems that are used to develop artificial intelligence, and so far only a handful of companies have the resources to develop them. While protecting the search business is essential to the company’s future, Google could make billions from allowing other companies to use its cloud computing services to develop their own A.I. services.Google said it made Bard, which can generate emails, shopping lists and poems, more intelligent and creative by running it on PaLM 2. The chatbot will be able to show and interpret images and allow users to export responses to Gmail, Docs and other applications.The company has started integrating generative A.I. into its Workspace applications, including Gmail, Docs and Sheets. Users will be able to use brief text descriptions to create images for a slide deck or draft documents, with options to change the writing style to be more professional or casual.Since ChatGPT was introduced, Google has faced criticism from tech industry insiders that it had not moved fast enough to improve its search. But Ms. Reid said the company’s large number of users was “the chorus we should listen to the loudest.”“There is still huge opportunity in the world in meeting people’s information needs and there will always be lots of people trying to solve it, and I think that’s great,” she said. “It will help us — help everyone — evolve.”Investors have been closely watching Google’s A.I. progress, and they have been concerned about the competitive threat from OpenAI and Microsoft. Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said in an interview that this year’s presentation did not “end the concerns, but it partially addresses them.”“They needed to remind people that they’ve been doing a lot of innovation in A.I. for a long time,” he said, “and they got that point across.”]\n",

      "[An article on Saturday about an increased visibility of the northern lights to the south described incompletely the timing of the reversal of the earth’s magnetic field. It happens once every 10,000 to 50 million years or more, not once every 10,000 years.An article on Saturday about a bill passed by the Florida Legislature banning gender-transition care for minors misstated the acronym of an advocacy group that has sued Florida over a prohibition on what experts call gender-affirming care for minors. It is GLAD, not GLAAD.An article on Tuesday about the victims of a mass shooting at a mall in Texas misstated the decade of Kyu Cho’s birth. It was the 1980s, not the early 1990s.An article on Tuesday about Phoenix’s plan to start clearing a large homeless encampments in the city incorrectly described a legal action that occurred in December. The city of Phoenix was ordered by a federal judge that month to not enforce bans on sleeping or camping outside, in response to a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union. It reached a tentative settlement with the A.C.L.U. in March, not in December.An article on Monday about the task of fact-checking information from A.I. chatbots referred imprecisely to ChatGPT’s response to a question about a meeting between James Joyce and Vladimir Lenin. Its response about the men having met in a cafe may have been based on accounts of such a meeting, including a fictional one, but the possible meeting at the Cafe Odéon was not entirely fabricated by ChatGPT.A Critic’s Notebook column on Tuesday about the Long Play classical music festival in Brooklyn misidentified a composition included in a presentation by the Momenta Quartet. The group led its set with Alvin Singleton’s second quartet, not his third.A film review on Friday about “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” misidentified the actress who plays a secondary antagonist along with Will Poulter. It is Elizabeth Debicki, not Maria Bakalova.An obituary on Saturday about Laura Pels, a leading benefactor of nonprofit theater, misstated the location of the Laura Pels Theater when it opened in 1995.

It was 2014, not 2013. It also misstated the name of the orchestra with which he performed when he was 16. It was the Palestine Symphony Orchestra; it did not become the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra until about a decade later.An Overlooked obituary on April 10 about the early 20th-century chemist Alice Ball misstated Stanley Ali’s affiliation.

      "[Television loves a good sentient-machine story, from “Battlestar Galactica” to “Westworld” to “Mrs. Davis.” With the Writers Guild of America strike, that premise has broken the fourth wall. The robots are here, and the humans are racing to defend against them, or to ally with them.Among the many issues in the strike is the union’s aim to “regulate use of material produced using artificial intelligence or similar technologies,” at a time when the ability of chatbots to auto-generate all manner of writing is growing exponentially.In essence, writers are asking the studios for guardrails against being replaced by A.I., having their work used to train A.I. or being hired to punch up A.I.-generated scripts at a fraction of their former pay rates.The big-ticket items in the strike involve, broadly, how the streaming model has disrupted the ways TV writers have made a living. But it’s the A.I. question that has captured imaginations, understandably so. Hollywood loves robot stories because they make us confront what distinguishes us as human. And when it comes to distinguishing features, the ability to conjure imaginary worlds is simply sexier than the opposable thumb.So the prospect of A.I. screenwriting has become potent, both as threat and rallying cry. Detractors of the striking writers taunted them on social media that software was going to horse-and-buggy their livelihoods. Striking WGA members workshopped A.I. jokes on their picket signs, like “ChatGPT doesn’t have childhood trauma.” (Well, it doesn’t have its own. It has Sylvia Plath’s, and that of any other former unhappy child whose writing survives in machine-readable form.)But it shouldn’t surprise anyone if the TV business wants to leave open the option of relying on machine-generated entertainment. In a way, it already does.Not in the way the WGA fears — not yet. Even the most by-the-numbers scripted drama you watch today was not written by a computer program. But it might have been recommended to you by one.Algorithms, the force behind your streaming-TV “For You” menu, are in the business of noticing what you like and matching you with acceptable-enough versions of it. To many, this is indeed acceptable enough: More than 80 percent of viewing on Netflix is driven by the recommendation engine.In order to make those matches, the algorithm needs a lot of content. Not necessarily brilliant, unique, nothing-like-it content, but familiar, reliable, plenty-of-things-like-it content. Which, as it happens, is what A.I. is best at.The debate over A.I. in screenwriting is often simplified as, “Could a chatbot write the next ‘Twin Peaks’?” No, at least for now. Nor would anyone necessarily want it to. The bulk of TV production has no interest in generating the next “Twin Peaks” — that is, a wild, confounding creative risk. It is interested in more reboots, more procedurals, more things similar to what you just watched.TV has always relied on formula, not necessarily in a bad way. It iterates, it churns out slight variations on a theme, it provides comfort. That’s what has long made strictly formatted shows like “Law & Order” such reliable, relaxing prime-time companions. That’s also what could make them among the first candidates for A.I. screenwriting.Large language models like ChatGPT work by digesting vast quantities of existing text, identifying patterns and responding to prompts by mimicking what they’ve learned. The more done-to-death a TV idea is, the greater the corpus of text available on it.And, well, there are a lot of “Law & Order” scripts, a lot of superhero plots, a lot of dystopian thrillers. How many writers-contract cycles before you can simply drop the “Harry Potter” novels into the Scriptonator 3000 and let it spit out a multiseason series?In the perceptive words of “Mrs. Davis,” the wildly human comedic thriller about an all-powerful A.I., “Algorithms love clichés.” And there’s a direct line between the unoriginality of the business — things TV critics complain about, like reboots and intellectual-property adaptations and plain old derivative stories — and the ease with which entertainment could become bloated by machine-generated mediocrity.After all, if studios treat writers like machines, asking for more remakes and clones — and if viewers are satisfied with that — it’s easy to imagine the bean counters wanting to skip the middle-human and simply use a program that never dreamed of becoming the next Phoebe Waller-Bridge.And one could reasonably ask, why not? Why not leave the formulas to machines and rely on people only for more innovative work? Beyond the human cost of unemployment, though, there’s an entire ecosystem in which writers come up, often through precisely those workmanlike shows, to learn the ropes.Those same writers may be able to use A.I. tools productively; the WGA is calling for guardrails, not a ban. And the immediate threat of A.I. to writers’ careers may be overstated, as you know if you’ve ever tried to get ChatGPT to tell you a joke. (It’s a big fan of cornball “Why did the …” and “What do you call a …” constructions.) Some speculations, like the director Joe Russo’s musing that A.I. some day might be able to whip up a rom-com starring your avatar and Marilyn Monroe’s, feel like science fiction.But science fiction has a way of becoming science fact. A year ago, ChatGPT wasn’t even available to the public. The last time the writers went on strike, in 2007, one of the sticking points involved streaming media, then a niche business involving things like iTunes downloads. Today, streaming has swallowed the industry.The potential rise of A.I. has workplace implications for writers, but it’s not only a labor issue. We, too, have a stake in the war with the storybots. A culture that is fed entirely by regurgitating existing ideas is a stagnant one. We need invention, experimentation and, yes, failure, in order to advance and evolve. The logical conclusion of an algorithmicized, “more like what you just watched” entertainment industry is a popular culture that just … stops.Maybe someday A.I. will be capable of genuine invention. It’s also possible that what “invention” means for advanced A.I. will be different from anything we’re used to — it might be wondrous or weird or incomprehensible. At that point, there’s a whole discussion we can have about what “creativity” actually means and whether it is by definition limited to humans.But what we do know is that, in this timeline, it is a human skill to create a story that surprises, challenges, frustrates, discovers ideas that did not exist before. Whether we care about that — whether we value it over an unlimited supply of reliable, good-enough menu options — is, for now, still our choice.]\n",

      "[I’ve made a decision that I feel very good about: the theme of my summer fiction reading this year is going to be snobbery.This dovetails with my interest in the ways that status and hierarchies limit political change and fuel backlashes. But snob fiction is the fun, lighthearted cousin: books that focus on the odd habits and eccentric preoccupations of people at the top of a particular status hierarchy, and the wild flailing that results when an outsider tries to gain entry — or an insider tries to escape.I’m enjoying “Pineapple Street,” by Jenny Jackson, which is set among the ultrarich of Brooklyn Heights in New York City. It has a sort of reverse-Edith-Wharton feel — characters at the height of wealth and status who are uncomfortable with the social implications of that privilege. It pairs well with the “Crazy Rich Asians” trilogy by Kevin Kwan, a humorous take on the marriage plot that’s set among Singapore’s very old and very new moneyed elite. And I didn’t really need an excuse to reread Plum Sykes’s socialite novels, “Bergdorf Blondes” and “The Debutante Divorcee,” which manage the difficult feat of being simultaneously warm and biting satire, but I’m happy to do it anyway. Sykes skewers New York high society via peripheral insiders — women who feel the need to economize, but whose idea of doing so is to buy their Chanel bags at sample sales instead of boutiques. They might roll their eyes at social doyennes deforesting the Southern Hemisphere in search of out-of-season pear blossoms to complete their party décor, but they’re still going to the parties anyway. (I haven’t read Sykes’s 2017 mystery “Party Girls Die in Pearls” yet, but the jacket copy promises “Clueless meets Agatha Christie,” a blurb clearly designed in a lab to get me to click “purchase now.”)And because I can’t quite resist getting analytical about all this, I’ve also picked up “Status and Culture,” by W. David Marx, which dissects the rules of why money can’t buy class, except when sometimes it can. The book is admirable in its breadth, and I appreciate that it takes even ‘low’ culture seriously as a force that brings meaning and conflict to people’s lives. But I came away thinking that he had set himself an impossible task. To be truly effective, the markers of status must be at least somewhat inexplicable, because as soon as a particular status can be pinned down, outsiders can copy it, which instantly destroys its potency. That means that any book that explains the rules of those markers will, on some level, render its own analysis obsolete.It also seemed like a good idea to pick up “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” by Walter Benjamin. A friend told me yesterday that she had returned to it while writing an article about artificial intelligence. I wonder what Benjamin would have made of ChatGPT?Susana, a reader in Puerto Rico, recommends “Walk the Blue Fields” by Claire Keegan:She writes beautiful prose, almost a poem. She takes the ordinary and makes it extraordinary. Her capacity for transforming the daily life into something beautiful is outstanding.Thank you to everyone who wrote in to tell me about what you’re reading.

      "[Working through the bankruptcy of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried’s collapsed crypto exchange, is proving more complicated all the time. The latest evidence: a potentially lucrative missed opportunity that’s come to light after FTX offloaded warrants to buy an obscure crypto token.The token is called Sui, and it made its trading debut on May 3. FTX — which is now being run by John Ray III, the restructuring expert who has recouped billions for creditors victimized by the mega-bankruptcies of Enron, Fruit of the Loom and Nortel Networks — sold its Sui warrants shortly before the token began trading.Had FTX exercised the warrants, it would own, as of this morning, an asset worth more than $1 billion, even after a 75 percent drop since the start of trading last week.Here’s what happened with Sui:FTX invested about $101 million in Mysten Labs last year. Mysten was building a blockchain platform called Sui that relied on technology developed for Diem, Facebook’s aborted crypto project. Mysten attracted investors like Andreessen Horowitz, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm, and the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, pushing its valuation at one point to about $2 billion.FTX led the fund-raising last summer. Its ownership interest included warrants for 890 million Sui crypto tokens that would be exercisable once the Sui platform launched. But FTX collapsed months later.In March, FTX sought the bankruptcy court’s permission to sell its interest in Mysten for about $96 million, or $5 million less than the initial investment.In April, that deal closed. On May 3, Sui tokens began trading, with prices quickly spiking. This morning, Sui was trading at $1.13.FTX is in a race to recoup every penny as the creditor list swells. Mr. Bankman-Fried himself has said that if given enough time, he could find the assets of value in his vast empire to begin to pay back customers and investors.The I.R.S. last month filed nearly $44 billion worth of “priority” tax claims against FTX’s estate and its sister trading firms, CoinDesk reports.FTX has already found billions for creditors. “The situation has been stabilized and the dumpster fire is out,” the company’s lawyers told a bankruptcy judge last month, revealing that they had recovered more than $7 billion.Among the crypto community on Twitter, however, there was some snickering that FTX missed a big opportunity in Sui.A top investor advisory firm U-turns on Jamie Dimon’s pay. Institutional Shareholder Services, which last week recommended that JPMorgan Chase shareholders oppose the bank’s compensation plan for its C.E.O. and other executives, changed its mind, citing mistakes in its analysis. It’s a remarkable reversal for I.S.S., which had also opposed JPMorgan’s pay policies last year.SoftBank posts a record $32 billion loss at its Vision Fund. The Japanese conglomerate’s tech-focused investment vehicle missed out on a broader rally in stocks. The downbeat report came as Masa Son, SoftBank’s founder, said the company was stopping new investments and focusing on the I.P.O. of Arm, its chip designer.Disney cuts down on streaming losses. The media giant chalked up the improvements to cost cuts and increases in subscription fees, and said it would start bundling Hulu content in its Disney+ app. But to save money on payouts of residuals, it will also start removing some content from its streaming platforms.George Santos pleads not guilty to 13 fraud charges. The first-term Republican lawmaker from New York was charged with wire fraud, money laundering, stealing public funds and lying on federal disclosure forms. But Speaker Kevin McCarthy said Santos could continue to serve in Congress, pending the outcome of a trial.Shares in Carl Icahn’s publicly traded investment vehicle fell 15 percent Wednesday, after it revealed that federal prosecutors in Manhattan had asked for documents in the wake of allegations by the short seller Hindenburg Research.But Mr. Icahn, the octogenarian billionaire who is known for a decades-long career of aggressively shaking up companies, made clear that he isn’t going down without a fight.A recap: Hindenburg, which makes money by betting that a company’s shares will fall, said in a report last week that Icahn Enterprises was running “Ponzi-like economic structures” by paying out an unjustifiably hefty dividend financed by stock sales. The short seller also said the company was fundamentally overvalued.The accusations have made their mark: Icahn Enterprises’ stock price is down 40 percent since Hindenburg published its report. That also hits Mr. Icahn directly, since the majority of his shares in the firm — he owns 84 percent of it — are pledged as collateral for bank loans.Mr. Icahn took the gloves off, calling Hindenburg a peddler of “disinformation campaigns to distort companies’ images, damage their reputations and bleed the hard-earned savings of individual investors.” He added that “unlike many of its victims, we will not stand by idly.”Meanwhile, Icahn Enterprises noted in a securities filing that federal prosecutors hadn’t accused the company or Mr. Icahn of any impropriety, and that it was cooperating with the inquiry. Hindenburg itself hasn’t accused either of fraud.But Icahn is also shifting strategy. He chalked up his company’s financial underperformance to its bets against the stock market, and said it would concentrate more on shareholder activism, the investment strategy that made Icahn a billionaire.Speaking of which, Mr. Icahn scored a victory in his fight against the gene sequencing company Illumina Wednesday, after the proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis recommended that investors approve two of his nominees for Illumina’s board.For months, Google has preached a more cautious approach to artificial intelligence, even as rivals and the public embraced ChatGPT and other new technologies as vanguards of the future.But at its annual developer conference Wednesday, the Silicon Valley giant unveiled a slew of A.I.-infused products, as it seeks to adopt a technology that, in the hands of competitors, could erode its hugely profitable businesses.Search was the star of the show. Google was eager to talk about the long-awaited revamp of its core service, which it hopes will steal back the buzz that Microsoft generated when it unveiled a ChatGPT-augmented Bing in February. The updated search engine will incorporate results generated by A.I. and allow users to ask follow-up questions. (Note, however, that it’s not a chatbot.)Two dozen other Google products, including Gmail, are also being A.I.-ified to help automate user tasks. But perhaps more important, the company revealed its work on more powerful A.I. models, including what it called PaLM2, that could power an even broader and more sophisticated array of services.“We are at an exciting inflection point,” Sundar Pichai, Google’s C.E.O., said Wednesday. But his longtime caution about a hasty embrace of A.I. — particularly a wariness of products spewing false or misleading information — remained. The new search engine clearly labels its A.I. aspects as “experimental,” and getting access to it requires signing up for the Search Labs service.That said, investors liked what they saw: Shares in Alphabet, Google’s parent company, rose 4 percent Wednesday, lifting its market value by $56 billion.— Donald Trump, the leading Republican candidate for president, urging his party to take a tough stance in negotiating spending cuts to the federal budget, even if that ultimately brings the country to default.The political debate over the investment approach known as E.S.G. — short for environmental, social and corporate governance issues — went national Wednesday, as a fight that has largely played out in state capitals moved to Congress.From the get-go, the hearing of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee was contentious, as Republican and Democratic lawmakers sparred with witnesses, and each other.Republicans called E.S.G. “​​an undemocratic tax” on Americans, designed to force an embrace of climate-focused policies that would raise costs for many. The hearing’s witnesses included the attorneys general of Alabama and Utah, who oppose letting their states’ retirement funds go into E.S.G.-guided investments.To Sean Reyes, Utah’s attorney general, E.S.G. was “an open conspiracy to bypass Congress and instead impose costly changes on American consumers,” driven by unelected financial institutions like BlackRock that have pushed to include climate concerns in many investment decisions.His Alabama counterpart, Steve Marshall, argued that focusing on E.S.G. led to higher energy prices because it discourages the use of cheaper fossil fuels, risking harm to key industries like farming.Democrats defended E.S.G. as just another investment strategy. Calling opposition to the concept a “widespread, highly coordinated, politically motivated attack” on investors and average Americans, the Illinois state treasurer, Michael Frerichs, said that E.S.G. was simply a different way of weighing risks and opportunities.It meant that an investor could weigh whether a carmaker was prepared for a market shift to electric cars, or whether to buy into a drugmaker facing a flurry of lawsuits over its role in the opioid epidemic, he said.Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, said that asset and pension managers weighing E.S.G. angles to investments were simply being smart — and to not think about those angles was “a negligent and inattentive investment strategy.”Expect the fight to continue. The committee’s Republican chairman, Representative James Comer of Kentucky, said lawmakers “would continue to expose and investigate harmful E.S.G. practices and hold unelected bureaucrats accountable for pushing their interests on the American people.”We’d like your feedback!

      "[Who would want to be a chief executive?The pressure on global business leaders has always been intense. But the challenges feel particularly acute right now.Top leaders oversee companies that employ hundreds of thousands worldwide. They can no longer rely on old-style hierarchical management techniques that are increasingly ineffective. They have to manage technology as both a huge threat and a huge opportunity. And many are being pushed by employees, investors and opinion makers to speak out and engage on social issues — even if it comes at a substantial cost.“It’s frankly a horrible job — I wouldn’t want it,” Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford University professor who studies C.E.O.s, once said. “Being a C.E.O. of a big company is a hundred-hour-a-week job. It consumes your life. It consumes your weekend. It’s super stressful. Sure, there are enormous perks, but it’s also all encompassing.”Of course, the bosses of multinational companies are well-paid. They are ambitious and often seek the power and thrills that come with being in power; no one becomes a chief executive by accident. And many of those who have had to deal with the stress of a financial crisis, an activist attack or a hostile takeover say they would do it again despite it all.But what does modern-day management look like, and how are business leaders confronting some of their thorniest challenges? This week, DealBook delved into some of the toughest dilemmas facing businesses and how C.E.O.s are navigating them:How should business engage with governments in an age of rising populism and tense geopolitics? The narrative of the post-Cold War world was economic integration, international supply chains and deepening trade ties. China’s economic development underpinned global growth for decades and was fundamental in helping the west recover after the 2008 financial crisis.Now, tensions between Washington and Beijing are putting companies in a bind. The pressure to decouple is growing and bipartisan. But it has come after many businesses spent decades trying to get the most out of China as a manufacturing center as well as a huge market. Last year, bilateral trade hit a record $690 billion— a sign that not everyone is ready to flee the world’s second-largest economy to please the political masters in the biggest one. Closer to home, executives are under intense scrutiny for the positions and commercial decisions they take on hot-button political issues, ranging from access to abortion to transgender rights. In a country as divided and vast as the U.S., that means a surefire money spinner in one market or state may be a political and reputational nightmare in another. All of this suggests it has never been more important to make the case for business to policymakers, but C.E.O.s who speak out publicly should expect to be clobbered, Matthew Gwyther writes.Is there a way to navigate the climate crisis without becoming a political target? The fight over companies’ approach to the environment has run straight into a political culture war. Shareholders, policymakers and commercial imperatives are pushing companies to put sustainability at the heart of their operations. But some powerful officials, such as the Republican governors in Florida and Texas, are bashing companies that pursue such policies and are winning political points by doing so. Some companies have found that saying less is best, Michael Skapinker reports.What is the right way to integrate artificial intelligence? ChatGPT, the A.I.-powered chatbot backed by Microsoft, has reshaped the conversation. Google declared it a “Code Red” for its long-dominant search business, and accelerated a big shift in its A.I. operations. More broadly, the transformative potential of the rapidly advancing technology is forcing C.E.O.s in every sector to balance the opportunity it presents with the disruption it will inevitably cause. Kevin Delaney writes about how business leaders are trying to introduce A.I. while preparing their employees for what comes next.What does the fight to get employees back to the office reveal about the end of top-down management? The parameters of the post-pandemic world of work are still up for negotiation. Some companies are forcing employees back to the office, with mixed results. What is certain is that the shift to a new, dispersed way of operating is here to stay because a lot of workers are demanding it. Executives used to being able to dictate the way we work are finding that it is all a bit more complicated. Establishing the right tone and relationship with employees is more essential than ever, Stefan Stern reports.Business leaders have always had to make difficult decisions. But as each of these dilemmas shows, the potential consequences of getting one wrong now can be swift and brutal. And there are no fixed or obvious solutions, however big the paycheck.Thanks for reading! We’d like your feedback. Please email thoughts and suggestions to dealbook@nytimes.com.]\n",

      "[There is no escaping Elon Musk. Having thrust himself, uninvited and often unwanted, into public consciousness, he is everywhere at once — an omnipresent, Orwellian Big Brother whose smirking visage is inescapable, a jokester, entertainer, troll, provocateur. Commenters lampoon his antics and question his business acumen, even his sanity, but what they don’t recognize — or perhaps what they don’t care to admit to themselves — is that there is a method to his clownish madness.Mr. Musk has become one of the world’s richest individuals by deploying a business model that relies on social media not simply to sell products but to sell the once-in-a-generation innovator who created them — the hyperactive, unconventional and very cool genius whose inventions are as smart, up-to-date and ingenious as their inventor. An essential ingredient in this model is the digital ingathering of an army of supporters who hang on his every word, promote his electric cars, cheer his rocket ships, take on his critics and in that way help keep the value of his Tesla shares, a major source of his wealth, elevated to the heavens.Past captains of industry, with few exceptions, carefully cultivated and projected images of stability, consistency, maturity — because that was what their customers and the markets and the public expected of them. Andrew Carnegie, J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller avoided public scrutiny because there was no real upside to calling attention to their monopoly-building schemes, the union-busting violence that had kept wages low and workdays extended, and the often corrupt government favors and funding that had added immeasurably to their fortunes. Mr. Musk has no need to project such probity because he inhabits a world in which it is almost taken for granted that great fortunes are built on attacks on competitors, the employment of nonunion labor and favorable deals with Washington.That’s not to say Mr. Musk can’t play the role of a staid captain of industry. When interacting with jittery analysts, or when he’s trying to assure advertisers threatening to bolt from Twitter, he can be soft-spoken, articulate, genial — even rather boring. He reacted nonchalantly when the right-wing firebrand Tucker Carlson announced he is bringing his show to Twitter. And Mr. Musk’s selection of Linda Yaccarino, NBCUniversal’s former advertising chief, as the next chief executive of Twitter makes sense for a company that has been bleeding advertising revenue.But Mr. Musk has another side that usually shows itself in the Twittersphere, where his army resides — the Mr. Musk who loves poop emojis and likened the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to Adolf Hitler.Mr. Musk freely admits that he paid “at least twice as much” for Twitter as he should have, that his timing was “terrible,” that his $44 billion investment has since fallen to about $20 billion. Yet that loss is a fraction of the value of his $180 billion net worth, much of which comes from his stake in Tesla. Even though Tesla’s profits fell in the last quarter and its share price has dropped roughly one-third from its peak in the past 12 months, it still trades at a rich sum. In a December newsletter devoted to trying to figure out why Tesla was worth as much as it is, the Times Opinion columnist Paul Krugman concluded that investors had fallen “in love with a story line about a brilliant, cool innovator.” On that day in December, Tesla shares were trading at $109.10; they are now trading at around $170. According to its shareholders, Tesla’s equity is still worth more than five times as much as that of Ford and General Motors combined.What Mr. Musk lost with his Twitter purchase also came with a significant gain of followers and, thus, influence. A year ago, Mr. Musk had about 90 million Twitter followers. He now claims 139 million, with millions more users being force-fed his tweets.Mr. Musk’s purchase of Twitter makes perfect sense given his business model. The platform provides him with a guaranteed, controlled, uncensorable, unedited outlet to market himself and his products. On Twitter he can freely promote his genius and his companies, advance his libertarian credos and conspiracy theories, troll his growing list of enemies, tell his bad jokes and feed the daily fears and doubts and hatreds of the not-so-merry band of fans who, very much like him, have lost faith in all other sources of intellectual, moral and cultural authority.He freely, almost joyfully, tweets, retweets and responds to critics and fans with the all-knowing self-assurance of a manic Dear Abby or a digital Delphic oracle, dispensing his wisdom on electric cars, rocket ships, social media, A.I. and myriad unrelated subjects. In a recent interview with Mr. Carlson, he cautioned that “if we don’t make enough people to at least sustain our numbers or perhaps increase them a little bit, civilization is going to crumble.” He’s offered scant evidence, statistics or facts to back up his warnings of population decline — but then, as a genius, he doesn’t have to.At a moment in our history when there is so much scorn heaped upon once revered political, intellectual, cultural and religious leaders, Mr. Musk has harnessed that distrust and wooed the cynical and unmoored to join forces with him. He requires nothing more of them than their fealty. And he offers in return not only his wisdom but also his humor, which they, surprisingly, perhaps, find to their tastes. Unlike other social media users, particularly those in politics and government, he offers his pearls of wisdom, his likes and dislikes, with a wink, not a scowl — an emoji rather than a lecture.After delivering near-apocalyptic prophecies, he dons his superhero/savior cloak to rescue the world from the dangers he warns us it faces. His electric cars will save the climate; should the climate not be rescuable, his rocket ships will transport human beings to Mars. His Starlink satellites provide “internet to the most remote areas,” including boats on “waters all around the world.” Twitter will give us the unvarnished, uncensored news that the mainstream press quashes. His yet-to-be-developed A.I. platform, TruthGPT, will be a “maximum-truth-seeking A.I.” and protect civilization from the dangers of the now popular chatbot ChatGPT, which, he warns us, is “being trained to be politically correct, which is simply another way of saying untruthful things.”Mr. Musk insists that he purchased Twitter because he believes in free speech and in citizen journalism. While other news sites edit and fact-check items, a Twitter-connected citizen journalist can post his or her “news” without any research or evidence. The result, which Mr. Musk champions, has been an outpouring of individual truths on the site. Chief among the citizen journalists tweeting forth their truths is Mr. Musk himself. The danger here is that he has conflated soapboxes and news organizations. Twitter is a soapbox, an amplifier; it is not, and can never be, a substitute for a news organization with reporters, editors and fact-checkers.Promoting Twitter-style “free speech,” Mr. Musk eschews debate, dialogue, argument. Because he controls the site and his engineers have adjusted the algorithms to amplify his tweets, he has converted Twitter into his own private trolling machine. Convincing his supporters that every other news source is biased, unbalanced and feeding the “woke mind virus,” he diminishes the quality and scope of public debate, and this at a time when we need to talk to one another, as a nation and as a people, about our priorities, our values and our policies at home and abroad.Instead of promoting the dialogue across ideological boundaries that we require, Mr. Musk sows mistrust, which deepens the divide. He has built a silo around his soapbox and locked himself and his followers inside. Every utterance from the outside can, from this vantage point, be dismissed as meaningless noise, “woke” propaganda, mischievous, misleading, dangerous lies. His truths alone stand inviolate, his genius intact, his products honored and selling.For better or worse, Mr. Musk is now the face of 21st-century capitalism, a world in which hype and image and endless publicity reign supreme. His antics are not a sideshow: They are inherent to his business, amplifying his wealth and his power.David Nasaw is an emeritus professor of history at the CUNY Graduate Center and the author, most recently, of “The Last Million: Europe’s Displaced Persons From World War to Cold War.”The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

      "[European antitrust regulators are set to weigh in Monday on Microsoft’s $69 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard. In a twist, the European Commission is reportedly set to approve a video game megadeal that its American and British counterparts have already rejected.If that happens, tech giants will be left with an even more confusing regulatory landscape to contend with, as three of the world’s most powerful antitrust regulators take different policy tacks.The E.U. is expected to be satisfied with Microsoft’s concessions on the deal, namely pledges to make sure top titles like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft are available to rival video game platforms like Sony’s and Nintendo’s.That would be a very different conclusion than that reached last month by Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority, which argued that Microsoft could end up dominating the nascent business of cloud gaming — and that no solution apart from selling off big chunks of Activision would be acceptable.It would be a striking show of leniency by a notoriously tough regulator. The E.U. has been among the most aggressive in policing Big Tech, having fined companies like Google billions and forced changes in their business practices. But in recent years, American regulators like the F.T.C., under Lina Khan, have gone even further, pushing back against takeovers by tech giants, and openly questioning whether they should get even bigger.Microsoft and others are left trying to navigate an increasingly complicated thicket of global rules, where regulators are coming to very different conclusions about the same issues. And given the size and importance of the British, European and U.S. markets, simply ignoring any one of them is impossible.The deal’s future is clearer, and bleaker, if the E.U. rejects it. Microsoft and Activision are already appealing the decisions by the F.T.C. and the C.M.A.; overturning the British regulator’s decision is expected to be especially tough. (The body that will weigh the C.M.A. appeal could take months, and will review only whether the regulator’s decision followed proper procedures.)Fighting a third battle — especially against a regulator that overwhelmingly tends to succeed in appeals — would only make an especially difficult fight that much harder.Twitter gets heat for silencing Turkey-related tweets. Critics accused the social network of kowtowing to Turkey’s hard-line leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, by blocking some politically themed posts in the country ahead of its election; the company said it was responding to “legal process.” As for the results: A runoff is set for May 28 after Mr. Erdogan failed to win a majority of the vote.Prepare for round two of debt-ceiling talks. President Biden said he planned to meet with congressional leaders on Tuesday as both parties remain deadlocked on how to avoid a default. Compounding the urgency: Tax revenues have plunged, pushing the U.S. government closer to the point where it won’t have the funds to pay its bills.American technologies are still finding their way to Russia. Illicit trade networks are facilitating the flow of aircraft parts made by Boeing and Honeywell to sanctioned Russian airlines, bolstering the country’s economy, The Times reports. Meanwhile, the Group of 7 and the E.U. this week plan to announce new bans on Russian gas imports.An activist investor is reportedly set to take on Shake Shack. Engaged Capital plans to seek three board seats at the struggling burger chain, The Wall Street Journal reports. Shares in Shake Shack have plunged by nearly half as consumers begin to pull back on spending.Two big mergers aim to reshape the commodities market. The pipeline operator Oneok has agreed to buy Magellan Midstream Partners for $18.8 billion in cash and stock to create one of America’s biggest providers of natural gas storage and transportation. Meanwhile, the Australian gold miner Newcrest Mining plans to acquire a top rival, Newmont, for $17.8 billion.Vice, the once-highflying digital media outlet, filed for bankruptcy overnight, as the punishing economics of online publishing took their toll.The company has received at least one rescue bid to acquire it out of Chapter 11, potentially sparing it a drawn-out and disruptive trip through bankruptcy. But the $225 million offer price is a reminder of how far Vice has fallen, taking some of the top names in media and finance with it.It was just six years ago that Vice was valued at $5.7 billion, as the upstart drew in investors like TPG, Disney, Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox and the advertising giant WPP.All those companies expected Vice — along with rivals like BuzzFeed and Vox — to reinvent the media business through a focus on youthful content and an ability to draw in reader eyeballs from social media platforms. At the time, Vice and its backers dreamed of going public or selling at an even higher valuation.Now those investors are set to be wiped out. Vice, like its peers, failed to wring profits from its audience, losing most of that revenue to the social networks that funneled readers to them. BuzzFeed has shut its news division and is at risk of being delisted from the Nasdaq, while Vox has slashed its valuation in half.Vice could soon be taken over by major creditors, led by Fortress and Soros Fund Management, who first lent the publisher $250 million in 2019. The two have offered to essentially convert what Vice owes them into equity, to the tune of $225 million, as well as assume other “significant liabilities.” (They would also likely keep on Shane Smith, the publisher’s outspoken co-founder and most prominent personality.)It’s unclear whether others will make offers, especially given the economic uncertainty around the online publishing business. For their part, Vice’s current leaders said the bankruptcy filing and subsequent sale would ultimately “strengthen the company.”Morgan Stanley is testing whether chat tools powered by artificial intelligence will give its wealth management clients an investment edge. Wendy’s hopes A.I. will speed up burger orders at the drive-through. And Samsung has reportedly banned workers from using chatbots, citing security risks.Business leaders are increasingly wrestling with how to use A.I. as ChatGPT and its rivals seize more and more of the public’s attention, and as customers, employees and investors ask where companies stand on the technology, Kevin Delaney writes for DealBook.Here’s what’s at stake:Moving too slowly may mean losing out on gains in productivity, customer service and — ultimately — competitiveness, similar to what happened to businesses that didn’t embrace the internet fully or fast enough. But at the same time, leaders must guard against the mistakes and biases A.I. often perpetuates and be thoughtful about what it means for employees.“Almost no matter which sector you are in, you need to be thinking about your company as becoming an A.I.-first company,” said Alexandra Mousavizadeh, chief executive at Evident, a start-up that analyzes finance companies’ A.I. capabilities.— Total family wealth in the United States in 2022, a more than threefold increase since 1989. More than half of that sum ($84 trillion) will be passed down from baby boomers to their heirs over the next 20 years, part of a massive intergenerational transfer of wealth, The Times calculates.With the clock ticking down to the X-date — when the U.S. government runs out of money to pay its bills — this could be a pivotal week in the debt-ceiling talks. Also, the regional banking crisis will be in focus at a series of hearings. And the spending power of consumers will be a big focal point of earnings and of data releases.Here’s what to watch:Tuesday: Greg Becker, Silicon Valley Bank’s former C.E.O., and two former top executives of Signature Bank are expected to testify before the Senate Banking Committee about why the lenders collapsed. Expect similar questions of Michael Barr, the Fed’s vice chair for supervision, who is set to appear before the House Financial Services Committee.Meanwhile, Home Depot and Baidu report earnings.

      "[One of our most popular recent writing prompts was inspired by an A.I.-generated track with fake Drake and the Weeknd vocals that went viral on social media last month, racking up millions of plays. The song was eventually removed from streaming platforms, but not before sending a scare throughout the music industry about the future of artificial intelligence in music.Will A.I. replace pop stars? we asked teenagers. Would you listen to music made by this technology?Many students said that curiosity would lead them to listen to an A.I.-generated song once, but they were convinced something would be missing: a lack of originality, passion, authenticity, soul. Others said all they cared about was whether the song was good. Read a selection of their comments below where they discuss the ethics of artificial intelligence, the future of live concerts, how A.I. could reshape the music industry and more. Thank you to all those who joined the conversation on our writing prompts this week, including students from Westlake High School in Westlake, Ohio; Vancouver, Wash.; Kentucky; and Washington, D.C.Please note: Student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear as they were originally submitted.Human singers have the ability to convey a wide range of emotions and add their own unique style to their music. They have the creativity and experience to interpret lyrics and to give them their own style. Music made with A.I. may be good, but it will never be the same as music sung by a good pop star.While A.I. can be a helpful tool for composers and producers to experiment with new sounds and styles, it will never replace the raw talent and artistry of human vocalists. — Sergi, Sant GregoriIn my personal opinion, the main allure of music lies in the emotional connection that it establishes with the listener. It’s not only about the melody or the lyrics, but also the sentiments and reminiscences that the music evokes. If I became aware that a song was completely generated by an artificial intelligence system, I would feel intrigued to listen to it, driven by my fascination with the underlying technology. Nevertheless, I might not feel as connected to the song on an emotional level as I would if it was composed by a human artist. — Aleena, Julia R. Masterman, Philadelphia, PAMusic and art in general created by actual humans is so important because otherwise, the creativity, emotions, vulnerability etc. would not be there. Even if the A.I. were to generate an emotional song, it would not be real because the A.I. would be basing the song off trends and older music, not actual emotion. A.I. cannot produce pop stars, most people love pop stars because they actually perform with emotion and have personalities. A.I. has neither. — Yasmin, Valley Stream NorthEven if the lyrics emulate a real pop star’s lyrics, whether it talks about heartbreak, love, or family, it would never have the same impact like one created by a real pop star because the listeners know it is all just to sound good and appeal to the listeners. It would have nothing to do with the artist themselves … Music is supposed to be relatable. When I listen to music, I like to listen to artists I know have gone through similar things or have the same feelings as me. — Sophia, Hinsdale Central High SchoolPop stars often have a unique charisma and talent that allows them to connect with their audience on a personal level, something that A.I. may struggle to replicate. Furthermore, the music industry is also heavily influenced by marketing and public relations, which can create a cult of personality around certain pop stars. This is not something that A.I. can replicate, as it lacks the personal identity and narrative that pop stars often use to connect with their audience. It is possible for A.I. to create popular music, but it is unlikely that it will completely replace pop stars.— Auon, Glen Ellyn, IllinoisI think the celebrity aura that comes with pop stars will always be attractive to the listener … I feel like if the song is made by A.I, there won’t be really any connection between the songwriter and listener. — James, New JerseyI would not mind listening to music that A.I. created, though it would be sad to lose the ability to watch that music live in the same way. There is an emotional connection that is generated between an artist and a listener, and that could be tainted if listeners can no longer feel physically present in the same space that the artists occupy. — Caden, Crossroads High SchoolI would be willing to listen to music created by A.I. However, I don’t think that it will ever replace music that is sung by humans because of things like concerts. The thrill of seeing your favorite artists onstage, singing along with them.: how could A.I. achieve the same feeling? Not to mention, there are so many unique voices and types of music such as rap, country, K-pop, just to name a few. Think of some of the top hits in the music industry. What comes to mind for me are primarily break up songs. Wouldn’t it feel weird listening to a robot singing about a breakup we all know never happened? Some artists now also add custom lines when it comes to concerts. Take Sabrina Carpenter for example, she changes the last line of her song every concert. The crowd anticipates it but never knows what she’s going to say. When she does, they go crazy. What about big events like Coachella or Summerfest that make millions of dollars in revenue. Would that be gone? — Sofia, Los Gatos, CAChatbots, such as ChatGPT, may be incredible advancements in technology, but they are taking away jobs from actual humans, and this is no different. If we support A.I. bands, we could be contributing to the destruction of the music industry, which would not only leave many people unemployed, but it would also lead to the ruination of creative expression in society. In other words, the incorporation of artificial intelligence into the arts could become incredibly detrimental to humans, as creativity and artistry are large components of what it means to be human. — Emily, New YorkI think I would listen to songs made with A.I, but most definitely with the consent of the artist. Their voice, which is basically the one thing they market, being used in such a manner without their knowledge is honestly really scary to think about. The music industry should be worried about the rise of A.I., because music as a whole might just, well, become a shell of itself. Lyrics feeling more like an empty plain rather than a cove of rich ideals, feelings and values. A.I. does really have me fearing for the future of everything.— Nidha, Valley Stream NorthThe success of “Heart on My Sleeve” is concerning for me and most likely to the music industry because it is going to be harder to distinguish real music from fake, and could lead to other people benefiting from the success of others. — Ethan, VSNI would listen to a song made by a machine — in fact, I have done it a lot. I have had a strong interest in vocal synthesizers, software that allows users to generate vocals for a song, for a few years now. If you have ever heard of VOCALOID, Synthesizer V, or CeVio, those are all vocal synthesizers. In recent years, these programs have also utilized A.I. technology, which helps its users create more realistic vocals with ease … But AI-generated songs seem to be made for exploitation and views. The singers involved have likely not given consent for their voices to be used in this way, and that could mean legal issues if a song like this is found to fall under something like false celebrity endorsement. I think this is part of a bigger problem related to AI art generation in general: what protections does an artist have against their work being used in this way? — Mikey, Valley StreamAllowing A.I. to overtake human-made A.I. art will debatably take the soul out of art and take jobs away from music artists. However, A.I. music should be used as a tool for artists to use to create art. For instance, artists should be able to use A.I. sampled instruments in a song if they do not have access to hiring professionals. Thus, through A.I., the music industry can be more inclusive for people who lack resources. I believe A.I. art can be used to produce popular pop music. Pop music is formulaic, a band called MGMT used the formula that most pop songs use and was able to create popular pop songs. Therefore, an A.I. system coded to be able to analyze the formulas of popular songs will most likely be able to create a popular catchy song. — Isabella, Valley StreamThe use of A.I. in the music industry has the potential to revolutionize the way music is made and consumed. One of the biggest benefits is the ability to create personalized music for each and every person. A.I. can also help artists create new and innovative sounds by listening to existing music. — Joem, MinnesotaI do think that A.I. is able to produce a No. 1 song and I also believe one day it will replace pop stars because most songwriters/rappers take a long time to release music or albums. With A.I. it would be easier to listen to new music from our favorite musicians. For example, the song “Heart on My Sleeve” rapidly became popular, and fans of those artists (Drake and The Weeknd) enjoyed it … Although A.I. music is threatening popular artists, fans seem to enjoy it. In my opinion, A.I. songs have changed the music industry and it will be difficult for fans to get over this new trend. — v.c., FlushingI do not think the music industry should be worried about the impact of A.I. in the future. The main reason why “Heart on my Sleeve” was successful is probably because people did not know what A.I. was capable of and many people were initially shocked. However, I strongly believe that A.I. will never be able to replace real artists. — Neja, VSNEven though I don’t like it, I can see an A.I. song becoming #1 on the charts because it brings shock value especially in this generation. It will become a trend but trends do eventually die out so I think it won’t last long because people will get bored and want real music that someone put actually thought behind and not just some tech generating what it thinks will be good. — Jada, New YorkA.I. can only copy, not create, and therefore should not be treated as the future of music. While I would listen to a good lo-fi tune, I would never, ever, consider A.I.-music as “real” music. Music is abstract and deep in meaning, and A.I.-generated songs discredit it. — Natalie, CAI would 100% listen to a song if I knew if it was sung by a machine. I already have, through social media platforms, such as TikTok. I think it is insane how A.I. can replicate voices, and have them sing distinct notes, phrases, and rhythms to fit other songs. And it sounds believable too!— Sofia G., Valley Stream NorthHonestly, I think I would still listen to music if it was sung by a machine, because I don’t really care who the song is written by as long as it sounds good. As of now, I don’t even pay attention to who sings some songs when I’m listening to them … I think after reading this article, I’m partly afraid yet also excited, because I would love to see what A.I. can come up with next. — Sarah, Marlborough SchoolI’ve seen a few TikTok’s of people using A.I. to make it sound like artists like Kanye West or Olivia Rodrigo are singing Taylor Swift songs. I listened to them for fun and I find it very fascinating how A.I. is able to recreate these artists’ voices and make it so accurate. However, I don’t think that listening to a song purely made from A.I. would have the same meaning to me. — Mia, Valley StreamHonestly I would definitely listen to music made by A.I. because if I think it sounds good, and I like it, more than likely I will listen to it. I think the rapper whose vocals are impersonated should get an incentive for that, but I think that A.I. has been used for so long behind our backs, and now that it’s slowly getting crazier and crazier, it’s going to be the new norm. — Abram, Atrisco Heritage AcademyLearn more about Current Events Conversation here and find all of our posts in this column.]\n",
